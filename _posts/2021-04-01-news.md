#### IMPORTANT
 1\. **Tommy Tuberville was sworn in as a U.S. Senator for Alabama on Saturday.** He released a statement saying "[Alabamians] can rest assured that I’m going to wake up every day with one mission – to speak for the people of Alabama.” The political newcomer was sworn-in the day after making an announcement that he would join a group of 11 Senators led by Ted Cruz of Texas, in contesting electors from disputed states in the recent presidential election, until a commission from Congress can review all claims of fraud.

#### NORTH ALABAMA
 2\. **Two Alabama law enforcement officers will go to court this year.** William Darby of HSV PD is charged with the murder of Jeffrey Parker, who called 911 saying he was suicidal. Darby was initially cleared of wrong doing and was later indicted by a grand jury. Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely is charged with embezzlement and soliciting money from employees. He has continued in his position as Sheriff while awaiting trial. [Read more](https://whnt.com/news/alabama-news/two-north-alabama-law-enforcement-officers-face-trials-in-2021/).

#### SPOTLIGHT
Duncan Farms has started a new service called [Huntsville Compost](https://huntsvillecompost.com/). Subscribers will leave compost on their front porches to be collected weekly by the company (anywhere up to 25 minutes outside of HSV) for $35.99 per month in exchange for store credit toward products at Duncan Farms’ organic farm store. The company will use the compost to make clean soil as a part of their no-chemical-fertilizers, no-pesticides manifesto.

Donovan Duncan, the owner of Duncam Farms, hopes this program will create a local food system to help slow a coming crisis, the degradation of soil able to produce crops which some scientists say could occur within the next 30 or so years.
